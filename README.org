 [[Creating projects, subprojects, sections, tasks, and subtasks][See the usage section to learn the mapping rules for projects, sections, and tasks.]]

** How it works
Commands are automatically detected and batched by diffing the current ~org-todoist-file~ with the abstract syntax tree from a snapshot of the previous sync and nodes are updated in place using a single asynchronous request, meaning metadata, such as time tracking information, /is retained/.

Syncing is done using the [[https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/][Todoist sync API]], which sends a single request for both pulling and pushing. *Local changes will overwrite remote changes!*

* Installation
** Doom Emacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-todoist
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "lillenne/org-todoist"
           :branch "main"
           :files ("org-todoist.el")))
#+end_src
* Usage
org-todoist provides an interactive transient menu interface that can be accessed via:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-todoist-dispatch)
#+end_src

This menu provides easy access to all org-todoist commands and displays the current status of features like background sync and remote deletion.

** Autoloads
The following commands (and more!) are automatically available after installation (no require needed):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Sync commands
(org-todoist-sync &optional ARG) ;; Sync with Todoist. With ARG, don't open buffer after sync
(org-todoist-background-sync) ;; Start background sync at configured interval
(org-todoist-cancel-background-sync) ;; Stop background sync
(org-todoist-toggle-background-sync) ;; Toggle background sync on/off
(org-todoist-ediff-snapshot) ;; Compare current file with last synced state
(org-todoist-toggle-remote-deletion) ;; Toggle deletion of remote items

;; Task management
(org-todoist-assign-task)
(org-todoist-unassign-task)
(org-todoist-ignore-subtree)
(org-todoist-add-subproject)

;; Capture integration
(org-todoist-project-notes)
(org-todoist-find-project-and-section)

;; Diagnostics
(org-todoist-diagnose)
(org-todoist-report-bug)
#+end_src

** Bidirectional sync
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Sync commands and options:
(org-todoist-sync &optional ARG)     ;; Perform incremental sync. With ARG, don't open buffer
(org-todoist--reset &optional ARG)   ;; Full reset from Todoist. With prefix ARG (C-u):
                                    ;; - Single prefix: Don't open buffer
                                    ;; - Double prefix (C-u C-u): Delete and recreate file

;; Background sync:
(org-todoist-background-sync)        ;; Start background sync at configured interval 
(org-todoist-cancel-background-sync) ;; Stop background sync
(org-todoist-toggle-background-sync) ;; Toggle background sync on/off
#+end_src

*Local changes will overwrite remote changes!*

** Creating projects, subprojects, sections, tasks, and subtasks
Simply create org headlines! The corresponding Todoist types (projects, subprojects, sections, tasks, and subtasks) will be inferred from the org structure. Sections will be preferred over subprojects unless the ~TODOIST_TYPE~ property is set to ~PROJECT~. A new subproject can be created quickly using the interactive function ~org-todoist-add-subproject~. If a TODO item does not fall under a project, it will be assigned to the default section of the Inbox project.

| Level | Todoist Type          |
|-------+-----------------------|
|     1 | Project               |
|    2+ | Section or Subproject |
|  TODO | Task                  |

** Updating projects, sections, and tasks
Updating items happens automatically when updating any headline, description, todo-state, todo-keyword[fn:4], priority, effort, tag, scheduled time / range, deadline time, or assignee OR when any project, section, or task is moved under another headline. /This works with standard org commands (e.g., ~org-refile~)./
** Deleting items
When the ~org-todoist-delete-remote-items~ variable is non-nil, removing items from the ~org-todoist-file~ (via deletion or refiling outside of the ~org-todoist-file~) will cause them to be deleted from Todoist. Additionally, items can be deleted by changing their ~todo-keyword~ to the ~org-todoist-deleted-keyword~.
** Tags, labels, and archiving
Org tags are mapped directly to Todoist labels and support inherited tags. Note, inherited tags will also be applied directly to the child tasks on next sync.

Projects and sections can be archived in Todoist by applying the ~org-archive-tag~ to the headline. Note, you cannot archive the default section and if you do locally on your org document it will not be synced.
** Comments and notifications
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       21eaaeab-ad6f-4fc1-abb6-4c39bf20e0bd
:END:
Comments are done via ~org-add-note~ and currently ([2025-01-12 Sun]) do not support editing or deletion from org mode. Within comments, other users can be notified via the ~org-todoist-tag-user~ command, which will prompt for completion of the desired user, send a request to notify them in the comment's note_add command, and input a special markdown syntax into the comment which will property display as @<User> in the Todoist app. If you prefer to use the org link syntax and have it look funny in the Todoist app, set ~org-todoist-comment-tag-user-pretty~ to non-nil.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Inserts the special tag from the todoist app that formats to @User
;; & adds the user id to uids_to_notify in the request
(org-todoist-tag-user)

;; non-nil to format in org link syntax instead of markdown for better viewing in org but worse in the Todoist app
(setq org-todoist-comment-tag-user-pretty nil)
#+end_src

** Assigning and viewing assigned tasks
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-todoist-assign-task) ;; Prompts for user selection and changes the responsible uid property to the user's id
(org-todoist-unassign-task) ;; Removes the responsible uid property
(org-todoist-show-assignee) ;; Show assignee as an overlay next to the current task
(org-todoist-show-all-assignees) ;; Show assignees for all tasks in the buffer
(org-todoist-my-tasks &optional ARG USER) ;; View an agenda of tasks assigned to USER (defaults to current user)
                                         ;; With prefix ARG, include unassigned tasks
(org-todoist-view-user-tasks USER) ;; View tasks assigned to a specific user
#+end_src

[[https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Lillenne/org-todoist/refs/heads/main/readme-images/assign.png]]

** Navigation and project views
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-todoist-goto) ;; Jump to the org-todoist file
(org-todoist-jump-to-project) ;; Select and jump to a project
(org-todoist-jump-to-current-project) ;; Jump to project matching current projectile project
#+end_src

** Opening in Todoist App
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-todoist-xdg-open) ;; Open current task in Todoist app
(org-todoist-xdg-open-project) ;; Open selected project in Todoist app
(org-todoist-xdg-open-search-query QUERY) ;; Open search results in Todoist app
(org-todoist-xdg-open-quickadd) ;; Open Todoist quick add panel
(org-todoist-open-last-quick-task-in-app) ;; Open the last quick-added task
#+end_src

Opening relies on ~browse-url-xdg-open~.

** Ignoring subtrees
If you'd like to keep other notes or TODOs alongside your projects and not have them synced to Todoist, you can mark a subtree as ignored by setting the ~TODOIST_TYPE~ property to ~IGNORED~ using M-x ~org-todoist-ignore-subtree~. Any org element descendent from an ignored node will not have its changes pushed to Todoist.

** Org capture to a Todoist project section
/Captures will automatically sync by default/ via the ~org-capture-finalize-hook~. If you would like to change this behavior, run ~(remove-hook 'org-capture-after-finalize-hook #'org-todoist--sync-after-capture)~.

Captures can be run from the transient interface with default capture templates via ~(org-todoist-capture-task)~. Alternatively, one can add their own templates like in the sample below:

Sample capture templates:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(nconc org-capture-templates
       `(("s" "Todoist")
         ;; Capture a TODO directly to the inbox
         ("sq" "Inbox" entry (file+olp ,(org-todoist-file) "Inbox" ,org-todoist--default-section-name) "* TODO %?")
         ("si" "Inbox" entry (file+olp ,(org-todoist-file) "Inbox" ,org-todoist--default-section-name) "* TODO %? %^G %^{EFFORT}p \nSCHEDULED: %^t")
         ;; Capture to a specific project, section, and parent task, creating them if needed.
         ;; Also prompts for tags, effort, task assignment, scheduled, and deadline times
         ;; Projects are determined by projectile if possible, otherwise via an interactive prompt
         ("ss" "Select Project" entry (function org-todoist-find-project-and-section) "* TODO %^{What is the task} %^G %^{EFFORT}p %(org-todoist-assign-task) %(progn (org-schedule nil) nil) %(progn (org-deadline nil) nil)\n%?")
         ;; Capture a note to an ignored subtree
         ("sn" "Project Notes" entry (function org-todoist-project-notes) "* %?")))
#+end_src

** Quirks
- Once a task has been permanently deleted in Todoist, changing the TODO state in org will be reset back to ~org-todoist-deleted-keyword~ on next sync. Todoist does not support reviving permanently deleted tasks.
- *Deadlines do not support time of day* and will be truncated to only include the date on the next sync. This is a limitation with Todoist.
- Adding durations via quick task requests does not work. This is on the Todoist side [2025-07-06 Sun].
- Comments on subtasks are added to both the root task and the subtask on Todoist, which is reflected here.
- The org element API does not properly parse property drawers if anything besides is put above them (e.g. adding your description above the property drawer), so don't do that!

* Configuration
** Required
Org Todoist requires a [[https://todoist.com/help/articles/find-your-api-token-Jpzx9IIlB][Todoist API token]] to function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todoist-api-token "<your-token>")
#+end_src

Additionally, Todoist markdown lists use 4 spaces vs the default 2 spaces for org plain lists. This is compenated for by using a file-local variable in the ~org-todoist-file~ header to set ~org-list-indent-offset~ to 2 (2 base + 2 offset = Todoist's 4). However, this means that when accessing the file for the first time, you will be prompted to allow "potentially unsafe" file-local variables. *You must accept this or manually set the value otherwise this may cause sync errors*.

** Updating from Sync v9 endpoint to the new unified API v1
Migrate your current ~org-todoist-file~ to conform to the new format via ~org-todoist-migrate-to-v1~
If you are running an unsupported API version, the transient interface will alert you and you can press 'V' to migrate.
** Optional
*** Core Configuration
- ~org-todoist-p1~ - Priority character for Todoist P1 (default: ?A)
- ~org-todoist-p2~ - Priority character for Todoist P2 (default: ?B) 
- ~org-todoist-p3~ - Priority character for Todoist P3 (default: ?C)
- ~org-todoist-p4~ - Priority character for Todoist P4 (default: ?D)
- ~org-todoist-priority-default~ - Default priority for new tasks (default: ?D)
- ~org-todoist-user-headline~ - Heading title for collaborators section (default: "Collaborators")
- ~org-todoist-metadata-headline~ - Heading title for metadata section (default: "Todoist Metadata")
- ~org-todoist-tz~ - Timezone for date conversions (default: system timezone)
- ~org-todoist-lang~ - Language for natural date strings (default: "en")
- ~org-todoist-my-id~ - Your Todoist user ID (auto-detected if name matches)

*** Interface
- ~org-todoist-show-n-levels~ - Fold level after sync:
  - nil = Don't change folds
  - 1 = Show projects
  - 2 = Show sections
  - 3 = Show root tasks
  - 4 = Show root tasks + 1 level of subtasks
  - 'no-fold = Expand everything
  - 'todo-tree = Show todo tree (default: nil)
- ~org-todoist-comment-tag-user-pretty~ - Format user mentions as org links instead of markdown (default: nil)
- ~org-todoist-mode~ - Minor mode for displaying user mentions and UIDs as human-readable names:
  - ~org-todoist-assignees-overlay~ - Show assignee names next to tasks automatically (default: t)
  - ~org-todoist-show-assignee-overlay-in-property-drawers~ - Display responsible_uid properties as user names (default: nil)

*** Behavior
- ~org-todoist-delete-remote-items~ - Delete items removed from org file (default: nil)
- ~org-todoist-duration-as-timestamp~ - Use timestamp ranges instead of EFFORT property for duration (default: nil)
- ~org-todoist-file~ - Todoist org filename (default: "todoist.org")
- ~org-todoist-use-auto-reminder~ - Use default reminders for new tasks (default: t)
- ~org-todoist-infer-project-for-capture~ - Use the current projectile project for capture templates if found (default: t)
- ~org-todoist-extract-deleted~ - Remove deleted items from org file (default: nil)
- ~org-todoist-storage-dir~ - Storage directory for sync data (default: $XDG_CACHE_HOME/org-todoist)
- ~org-todoist-command-batch-size~ - Maximum number of commands to send in a single sync request (default: 75)

The Todoist API has a limit of 100 commands per request. When syncing large changes, org-todoist automatically batches commands into smaller chunks to avoid hitting this limit. The batch size can be configured via ~org-todoist-command-batch-size~ (defaults to 75 due to API 503 errors at 100 during development).

*** Status Keywords
- ~org-todoist-todo-keyword~ - Active tasks (default: "TODO")
- ~org-todoist-done-keyword~ - Completed tasks (default: "DONE") 
- ~org-todoist-deleted-keyword~ - Deleted tasks (default: "CANCELED")

** Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting errors, you can use the following variables and methods:
- ~org-todoist-diagnose~ - Shows a pretty org-mode view of the information below
- ~org-todoist-report-bug~ - Copy the diagnostics view as GitHub flavored markdown and open the url to create a new issue.
- ~org-todoist--push-test~ - Returns the detected diff commands.
- ~org-todoist-ediff-snapshot~ to see changes since the last snapshot in ediff

* Why?
My wife uses Todoist and will never use Emacs. Even getting a shared /digital/ to-do list took a long time!

Also: Org mode is an excellent planning and note-taking tool, but struggles in a few areas:

- Collaboration with others
- Mobile app features / availability (shoutout to [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived][Orgzly for their great android app]])
- Sync between devices (I personally use [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] which works well, but will often have conflicts)

Todoist fills these gaps and, more importantly, (again) my wife uses it.

There is currently [[https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-todoist][another great integration]] for org-mode and todoist, but it takes a fundamentally different approach (stateless on-demand regeneration via many [[https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/#tag/Tasks][REST API]] requests vs stateful syncing with batched request to the [[https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/#tag/Sync][sync API]] that can be used to add additional org properties (/e.g./, track time) or queried by [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived][Orgzly]] on mobile.

* Contributing, Issues, and Feature Request
Feel free to submit an [[https://github.com/Lillenne/org-todoist/issues/new][issue or feature request]]! For issues, please use the inbuilt ~org-todoist-report-bug~ function. When submitting issues *please see the [[Troubleshooting][troubleshooting]] section and attach the response error information*. The ~org-todoist-report-bug~ function will put this information (and more) into your clipboard for you and bring you to the issues page. *Please redact anything sensitive in your tasks!* I'll do my best to address issues timely and evaluate feature additions. I work full time and have two /very/ young boys, so if there is a feature you want to add please feel free to submit a PR yourself!

** Todoist API Data

My personal test API call data is included in the repo to show the API return format and help my own development but is protected with [[https://github.com/getsops/sops][sops]]. If you need data for any reason, please use your own.

To test interacting with the Todoist API using curl with your own data, you can use the following commands. Note, Todoist has many great examples using curl in their [[https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/][API documentation]].

#+begin_src shell
curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token> " \
    -d sync_token='<sync-token or "*" for all data>' \
    -d resource_types='["all"]'
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    -d commands='[
    {
        "type": "item_complete",
        "uuid": "a74bfb5c-5f1d-4d14-baea-b7415446a871",
        "args": {
            "id": "<task-id>"
        }
    }]'
#+end_src

* Disclaimer
This package is not associated with, created by, or endorsed by [[https://doist.com/][Doist]] or [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]]

* Author's notes and recommendations
This is my first major elisp project, so I am almost certainly missing some best practices and useful tools. If you have any knowledge to share or want to contribute, please reach out, create an issue, or open a PR!

This package adds a lot of properties to property drawers. If you'd prefer not to see them, I recomment (and personally use) [[https://github.com/jxq0/org-tidy][org-tidy]].

If you set ~org-todoist--duration-as-timestamp~, you can easily perform daily timeblocking on Todoist tasks with [[https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock][org-timeblock]] from within Emacs. Alternatively, if you have /all/ of your org tasks on Todoist, Todoist does have a nice calendar interface now!

* Footnotes

[fn:1] CRUD: create, read, update, delete.

[fn:2] Recurring tasks only support a subset of Todoist scheduling features. e.g. Todoists "every mon, fri" is not easily recreatable using org mode. These tasks should still be pulled down correctly from Todoist on next sync.

[fn:3] Assignee is a Todoist-only idea, but is supported via the [[Collaboration]] commands.

[fn:4] Changing todo-keywords only triggers an update if the todo-state changes or the keyword is the ~org-todoist-deleted-keyword~.
