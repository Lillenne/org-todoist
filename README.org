* Org Todoist: What is it?
Org todoist is an emacs package for syncing [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode todos]] with [[https://todoist.com/][Todoist]]
* Why?
Org mode is an excellent planning and note-taking tool, but struggles in a few areas:

- Collaboration with non-neckbeards
- Mobile app features / availability (shoutout to [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived][Orgzly for their great android app]])
- Sync between devices (I personally use [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] which works well, but will often have conflicts when adding from the widget)

Todoist fills these gaps and, more importantly, my wife uses it.

There is currently [[https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-todoist][another excellent integration]] for org-mode and todoist, but it takes a fundamentally different approach (stateless on-demand regeneration with the [[https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#overview][REST API]] vs stateful syncing with the [[https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#overview][sync API]] that can be queried by [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived][Orgzly]] on mobile and buffer creation with org.el vs [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][org-element-api]]).

This is my first major elisp project, so I am almost certainly missing some best practices and useful tools. If you have any knowledge to share or want to contribute, please reach out, create an issue, or open a PR!
