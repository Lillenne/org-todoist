* Org Todoist: What is it?
Org todoist is an emacs package for *non-destructive bidirectional incremental sync* of [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode todos]] with [[https://todoist.com/][Todoist]] using org *exactly how you normally would* including:
- CRUD[fn:1] tasks
  - Complete by changing TODO state
  - Cancel by changing TODO state
  - Scheduling
  - Deadlines
  - Effort/Duration
  - Priority
  - Descriptions
  - Tags/Labels
  - Notes/Comments
  - Repeating tasks[fn:2]
  - Assignee[fn:3]
- CRUD[fn:1] new sections
- CRUD[fn:1] new projects
- Refile tasks and sections to other sections and projects

Commands are automatically detected and batched by diffing the current ~org-todoist-file~ with the abstract syntax tree of a snapshot of the previous sync and nodes are updated in place, meaning *unsupport metadata (such as time tracking information and additional properties) is retained*.

As a primary reason for developing this package, *Org Todoist also supports collaboration with other users* via assigning tasks and notifications.

* Features
** Bidirectional sync
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; When (not ARG), go to the Todoist buffer.
(org-todoist-sync &optional ARG)
#+end_src

** Collaboration
Assign tasks:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-todoist-assign-task)
(org-todoist-unassign-task)
(org-todoist-tag-user)
#+end_src

[[https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Lillenne/org-todoist/refs/heads/main/readme-images/assign.png]]
** Org capture to a Todoist project section
Captures will automatically sync by default via the ~org-capture-finalize-hook~.

Sample capture template:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      `(("i" "Inbox" entry (file+olp ,(org-todoist-file) ,org-todoist-project-headline "Inbox" "Default") "* TODO %? %^G %^{EFFORT}p \nSCHEDULED: %^t"))
#+end_src

** Quirks
- Once a task has been permanently deleted in Todoist, changing the TODO state in org will be reset back to org-todoist-deleted-keyword on next sync. Todoist does not support reviving permanently deleted tasks.
- Comments on subtasks are added to both the root task and the subtask on Todoist, which is reflected here.
* Configuration
NOTE: To match Todoist's priority structure, this package sets the user's ~org-priority-highest~ ~org-priority-lowest~ and ~org-priority-default~ values.

** Required
Org Todoist requires a Todoist API token to function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todoist-api-token "<your-token>")
#+end_src
** Optional
- ~org-todoist-delete-remote-items~
- ~org-todoist-file~
- ~org-todoist-use-auto-reminder~ - If newly created tasks should use Todoist's default reminder. Default ~t~.
- ~org-todoist-show-n-levels~ - The fold level of the org buffer after sync, with caveats. See docstring. Default show all.
- ~org-todoist-todo-keyword~ - New tasks are given this keyword.
- ~org-todoist-done-keyword~ - Completed tasks are given this keyword.
- ~org-todoist-deleted-keyword~ - Tasks with this keyword are deleted remotely.
- ~org-todoist-storage-dir~ - Directory for storing Todoist sync_tokens and the previous org file for detecting changes to push.

** Troubleshooting
For troubleshooting errors, you can use the following variables and methods:
- ~org-todoist-log-last-request~ - Set to non-nil to log the last outgoing request to the ~org-todoist--last-request~ variable
- ~org-todoist-log-last-response~ - Set to non-nil to log the last response json to the ~org-todoist-sync-dir~ and alist to ~org-todoist--last-response~. Any
- ~org-todoist--push-test~ - Returns the detected diff commands.

* Why?
Org mode is an excellent planning and note-taking tool, but struggles in a few areas:

- Collaboration with others
- Mobile app features / availability (shoutout to [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived][Orgzly for their great android app]])
- Sync between devices (I personally use [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] which works well, but will often have conflicts when adding from the widget)

Todoist fills these gaps and, more importantly, my wife uses it.

There is currently [[https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-todoist][another excellent integration]] for org-mode and todoist, but it takes a fundamentally different approach (stateless on-demand regeneration with the [[https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#overview][REST API]] vs stateful syncing with the [[https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#overview][sync API]] that can be queried by [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived][Orgzly]] on mobile and buffer creation with org.el vs [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][org-element-api]]).

* Contributing, Issues, and Feature Request
Feel free to submit an [[https://github.com/Lillenne/org-todoist/issues/new][issue or feature request]]! When submitting issues *please see the [[Troubleshooting][troubleshooting]] section and attach the response json (or at least the error information). I'll do my best to address issues timely and evaluate feature additions. I work full time and have two very young (0-3) boys, so if there is a feature you want to add please feel free to submit a PR yourself!

My personal test API call data is included in the repo to show the API return format and help my own development but is protected with [[https://github.com/getsops/sops][sops]]. If you need data for any reason, please use your own.

Things that I am not currently planning to implement (myself! you are welcome to!) due to time restrictions or it not being important to my workflow:
- File attachments
- Filters (use org agenda for this)
- Location notifications
- Updating or deleting comments
- Markdown support

* Disclaimer
This package is not associated with, created by, or endorsed by [[https://doist.com/][Doist]] or [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]]

* Author's notes
This is my first major elisp project, so I am almost certainly missing some best practices and useful tools. If you have any knowledge to share or want to contribute, please reach out, create an issue, or open a PR!

* Footnotes
[fn:1] CRUD: create, read, update, delete

[fn:2] Recurring tasks only support a subset of Todoist scheduling features. e.g. Todoists "every mon, fri" is not easily recreatable using org mode. These tasks should still be pulled down correctly from Todoist on next sync.

[fn:3] Assignee is a Todoist-only idea, but is supported via the [[Collaboration]] commands
